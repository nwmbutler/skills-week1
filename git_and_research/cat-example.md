## Version control example

Use the process of drawing a cat collaboratively to demonstrate how version control
works. 

* Write git commands on to a piece of card

* Draw a diagram of a local git repo and a remote git repo.

* Start drawing a cat and describe the commands to stage and commit this.

* Take a portion of the cat drawing and create a commit message and sha

* Continue drawing the cat and make another commit message and sha

* Demonstrate the staging by showing that you might want to only commit and
push a portion of your changes to the cat without losing some of the edits you
are making

* Ask for a volunteer to collaborate on your cat drawing

* Describe the process of pushing to a remote repository

* Describe the process of cloning a repo

* Demonstrate this by copying the diagrams and commits of the cat so far
and explain how git history works.

* Ask the volunteer to continue drawing the cat and commit and push this.


Git commands covered:
git init
git add
git commit
git status
git push
git pull
git clone
git log


After the workshop
* Ask a volunteer to diagram the process of a git workflow using the git
command cards

* Ask another volunteer to add commands which they can use to validate
their workflow

* Ask another volunteer to draw a description of what the commands means.

* Suggest they create their own git dictionary.
